# Introduction

Pandoc is a powerful file converter that gives power into the hands of the users.  
It is **completely free** as well.  
This website contains guides that aim to be quick and easy.  
These guides are designed to help walk new Pandoc users through converting their first files.  
> Start with the _Downloading and Installing_ guide, then choose either one of the _How to Convert_ guides.

Keep in mind that Pandoc is not a perfect converter.  
Users will probably have to **edit each converted file** to remove conversion errors, but **Pandoc does the hard, tedious work**.
